This is the first in what I hope will be a series of blog posts on my personal site's journey from ugly duckling to beautiful swan.

The idea is to start with a [vanilla Jekyll site](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/), [configured for GitHub pages](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/), then make it pretty--and in the process learn some HTML, CSS, JS, Liquid, and Markdown.
